To change the service parameters, find the registry folder

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\memcached Server

And change the ImagePath key to contain all desired parameters. To set the memory allocation to 128MB for example, add "-m 128" to it.

After you've done your changes, restart the service.
