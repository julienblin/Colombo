	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
		Hello and welcome to Plain 1.0 by me, <a href="http://www.oswd.org/userinfo.phtml?user=JayKay">
			JayKay</a>. As mentioned earlier this is a fairly simple template, powered entirely
		by css and xhtml. I am also trying to make as much use of whitespace as possible.
		Whitespace helps keep the page looking clean and easy on the eye, whilst improving
		readability also. As with all my templates, a limited number of images have been
		used, and when they have, they've been to aid the design. This results in an easily
		customisable template that can be used to an array of different sites.
	</p>
	<h1>CSS &amp; XHTML</h1>
	<p>
		As anyone looking for a website template to use would expect - this template is
		of course, both <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">CSS</a>
		and <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer">XHTML</a> valid according
		to the w3c. The benfits of this include;
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The website rendering correctly in a wide range of browser platforms</li>
		<li>Since CSS is used to maximise the aesthetics of the website the load times are extremely
			low making for an extremely accessable website.</li>
		<li>Low use of images saves bandwidth and improves load times</li>
	</ul>
	<p>

		stuff, follow this <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2004/xhtml-faq" target="_blank">

	<h1>About the Author</h1>
	<p>
		Hi there. My names Jay and I'm an 18 Year old web designer from the United Kingdom.
		My company; <a href="http://www.sixshootermedia.com" target="_blank">Six Shooter Media</a>

	<p>
		I also run my own personal <a href="http://www.jameskoster.co.uk">website</a>, which
		I use as a blog, a place to upload my photographs/drawings, do a bit of writing,
		and post news about my web design capers now and again. Along side this website,
		I've just opened another website which I use to host my templates and write tutorials
		for web design beginners. This can be found <a href="http://xij.p0wned.org/prettyasapicture/">

	<p>
		I make these web templates in my spare time as a kind of hobby, plus I like 'giving
		something back' to the web design community. Feel free to download and use this
		template as you wish - for you site or just for education purposes, but please leave
		the link to my website in at the bottom of the page, thanks.
